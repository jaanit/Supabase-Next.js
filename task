 Supabase + Next.js Developer Interview Task

Thank you for applying for this position.

We have a task prepared for you, that you must complete using Next.js, Supabase, and TypeScript. 3days

Feel free to use anything that can help you complete this (except the help of another human).

send me this after you finish :
- The public URL to your GitHub repository
- The login credentials for the account on supabase.com, which has the database
- The preview URL for the project hosted on Vercel.
- The login credentials for both of the users in the application.

## The Task

Create a dashboard for a business listing management platform. The application will have multiple users who will create and manage the businesses.

The dashboard should have the following pages:

- An index page listing every business from the database. The following data should be shown on the index page for every business: the name of the business, the email address of the user who created the business, and the date when the business was created.
- A page to create a new business. The page should contain a form with an input field for the name of the business. There should be a save, and a cancel button on the page. The save button should redirect the user to the index page if the action was successful. Show a toast message if there was an error.
- A page to edit an existing business. The page should contain a form with an input field for the name of the business. There should be a save, a cancel, and a delete button on the page. The delete and the save buttons should redirect the user to the index page if the action was successful. Show a toast message if there was an error.

The application should have at least two users in the database.

Every user can see all the businesses, but they can edit or delete only the ones they created. Create RLS policies for this.

We expect to see solutions that utilize Next.jsâ€™ server-side features.

Create simple pages for authentication too.

## Technologies

You must use Next.js with TypeScript. Use the app directory of Next.js.

Create a Supabase project, which is connected to the application.

Your application should be hosted on Vercel.

We have prepared a starter repository template for this interview task. Create your project on Github based on this template and use the utilities inside the lib folder. Here's the link for the repository: https://github.com/a-str-o/Supabase-Next.js

## The evaluation

Your application should be implemented according to the requirements, and it should work without bugs.

The visual design will not matter when we evaluate your solution. Just create a user-friendly layout, and you are good to go.

However, we will score your solution based on the architectural design, code quality, and type safety.

Have fun with the task! ðŸ¤œ ðŸ’¯
